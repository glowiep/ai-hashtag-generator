- Axios is used instead of fetch() for HTTP requests.
- Additional feature - Copy keywords to clipboard button.

## Getting Started âœ¨

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```


Rename `.env.example` to `.env` and add your API key. You can get your key at [https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).

```bash
VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY='ADD_YOUR_KEY_HERE'
```

Important: Your API key is not secure as there is no backend. If you decide to use this tool in production, you should add a backend to it and store the API key there.

Run the dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

To build for production:

```bash
npm run build
```
